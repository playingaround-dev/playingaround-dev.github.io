      <description>Make sure to know your tools very well before you start off using them. Know all/most of their default configurations, settings, as well as understand what implication tweaking any of these has on overall system, as well as other parts of the system.

Measure performance of every component of your system, and how much it can be overloaded, and for how long.</description>
