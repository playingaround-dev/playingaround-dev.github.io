      <description>Have you ever desired to host your own personal blog, or a website to showcase your work, for free? All this while taking advantage of a globally distributed CDN to speed up the site&amp;rsquo;s delivery to your visitors?
 Github Pages gives us exactly that!! It give us the ability to host static content (blog/website) for free. We can use that to showcase our work, highlight our achievements, share our resume, setup our personal blog, etc.</description>
